### For front-end developers

Jekyll Codex is created by J.H. van der Schee (twitter: @jhvanderschee) to help fellow front-end developers and designers utilise static web technology in their work, without touching the command-line. 


### Why Jekyll?

Jekyll is the most popular Static Site Generator. Static sites are better for performance, they're cheaper to build and maintain, and they're much more secure than traditional database driven websites. Thus offering a great added value for front-end developers and their clients. 

### The goal
Jekyll Codex wants to make it easier for you to choose for Jekyll in your next project.
