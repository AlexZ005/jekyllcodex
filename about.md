### For front-end developers

Jekyll Codex is created by Joost van der Schee (<a href="https://twitter.com/jhvanderschee" target="_blank" style="color: #777777;">@jhvanderschee</a>) to help fellow front-end developers and designers utilise static web technology in their work, without touching the command-line. If you are not a front-end developer, or you like nerdy stuff, please visit the official Jekyll documentation. The link can be found in the menu at the top.

### Why Jekyll?

Jekyll is the most popular Static Site Generator. Static sites are better for performance, they're cheaper to build and maintain, and they're much more secure than traditional database driven websites. Thus offering a great added value for front-end developers and their clients.
