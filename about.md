### Why this website?
-----

Jekyll Codex is created by J.H. van der Schee to help fellow front-end developers and designers utilize static web technology in their work, without touching the command-line. Static sites are better for performance, they're cheaper to build and maintain, and they're much more secure than traditional database driven websites. Thus offering a great added value for front-end developers and their clients. Jekyll Codex wants to make it easier for you to choose for Jekyll in your next project.
