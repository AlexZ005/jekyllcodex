I"k<p>I have written a three step <a href="/getting-started/">Getting Started manual for Jekyll</a>. The manual can be followed by anyone (no command line needed). Everything you need to do, can be done in a browser and a text editor.</p>

<p>Jekyll/a static sites are quick to develop, simple to adjust, hosting is cheaper and they can be easily optimized for SEO and speed. As a bonus, static websites are extremely stable and they can handle a huge amount of visitors.</p>

<p>So do you want a next-generation website? Follow the <a href="/getting-started/">manual</a>! Your first Jekyll site is only minutes away!</p>
