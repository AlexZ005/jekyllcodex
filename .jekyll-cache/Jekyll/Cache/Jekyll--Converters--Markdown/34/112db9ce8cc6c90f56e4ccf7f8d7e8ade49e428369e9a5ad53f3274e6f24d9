<p>Lightbox is a solution that loads your <a href="/uploads/grumpycat2.jpg" class="gray">image</a> <a href="/uploads/grumpycat.jpg" class="gray">links</a>, your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0" class="gray">Youtube links</a> and your <a href="https://vimeo.com/132888648" class="gray">Vimeo links</a> automatically in a minimalistic and responsive pseudo window/overlay. No adjustment to your links is required, just follow the installation instructions below.</p>

<h3 id="how-it-works">How it works</h3>

<p>Links that point to images, Youtube and Vimeo video’s are automagically recognized and provided with an additional class by jQuery. Video’s get an additional data-id in case of a video. A listener adds the lightboxes to the body on a click on the link. The lightboxes is removed when you click on the background/overlay. You can prevent links from turning into lightboxes, by adding the ‘no-lightbox’ class. To achieve this in Markdown, simply use the code below.</p>

<pre><code>[video link](https://youtu.be/iWowJBRMtpc?t=90s){:.no-lightbox}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I wrote this lightbox myself and tested it on a minimal amount of devices. It should work on mobile (tested on Android), IE9+ and all modern desktop browsers (tested on Firefox).</p>
