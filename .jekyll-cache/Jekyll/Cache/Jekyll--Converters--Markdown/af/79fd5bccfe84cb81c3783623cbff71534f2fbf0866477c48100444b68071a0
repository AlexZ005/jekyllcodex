<p>I love internet memes. Especially internet memes about the internet. Ofcourse there is <a href="/uploads/grumpycat2.jpg" class="gray">grumpy cat</a> and the good old <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0" class="gray">rickroll</a>, but there is nothing quite as satisfying as making fun of <a href="/uploads/macdonaldsrump.jpg" class="gray">Mac Donalds rump</a>. And fortunately the big leader does not stop at saying they cost only three dollars. Because the fun thing about websites being so cheap, he explains, is that you can have so many websites, you can literally have them <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkcqAkvZKlo" class="gray">all over the place!</a> That is right. All over the place. I think he refers to Amazon, GoDaddy, Bluehost, Google, etc., but I am not sure. He might also be referring to the internet itself. Who knows…</p>

<p>So you might catch me soon, sitting at a bar, being wasted, wearing my ‘you are the CSS to my HTML’ t-shirt and trying to impress a girl with the following lines: “Wait listen… I have so many websites, I have them seriously… burp… all over the place… so many. And they cost me only three dollars. I just hire people.”</p>
