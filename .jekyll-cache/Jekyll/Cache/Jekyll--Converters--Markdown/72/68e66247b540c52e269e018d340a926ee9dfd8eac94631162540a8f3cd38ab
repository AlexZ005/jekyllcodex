I"™<p>Today I have made some improvements to the form builder. It is now possible to have multiple forms on one page. I also added Netlify as a form engine. Netlify is a hosting platform for static websites that can also handle form submissions. Note that Netlifyâ€™s free plan limits you to 100 submissions per month. If your website sends more forms you will be bumped to the paid plan, which starts at a hefty 45 dollar a month. Therefore you need to enable a recaptcha on your form (otherwise you will end up paying for the spam submissions alone). To do so I added â€˜recaptchaâ€™ as a new â€˜input typeâ€™.</p>

<p>If you use Netlify as your form engine, you only need to write this in your form builder:</p>

<pre><code>- name: recaptcha
  input_type: recaptcha
  placeholder:
  required: true
</code></pre>

<p>If you do NOT use Netlify as your form engine, but one of the others (cloudcannon, formspree or formbucket), you need to write this:</p>

<pre><code>- name: recaptcha
  input_type: recaptcha
  placeholder: [your recaptcha site-key]
  required: true
</code></pre>

<p>Additionally you need to add this to your head (non-Netlify only):</p>

<pre><code>{% if page.forms %}&lt;script src='https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;{% endif %}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the above code assumes you use the latest version of the <a href="/without-plugin/form-builder/">form builder</a>. Happy coding!</p>
