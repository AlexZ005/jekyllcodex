## Layout

### Different templates

If you need different templates, for posts and pages for example, you can create them in the directory '_layouts'. Your template is alsmost the same as your 'index.html' file, you created in the 'Getting started'. The only difference is that you should name it something like 'post.html', 'page.html' or 'default.html' and that you should replace the content with 

<pre>&lcub;&lcub; content &rcub;&rcub;</pre>

Furthermore you add to your 'index.html' file a three extra lines at the top.

<pre>---<br />layout: page<br />---</pre>

### Pretty URL's

When you want your URL's to be pretty, simply use the 'old-school' approach. Create an 'index.html' in the root for the homepage and a folder called 'about' with another 'index.html' file inside for your 'about' page... and so on. You will take advantage of this on a later moment when you need to build a menu, based on the page hierarchy.
