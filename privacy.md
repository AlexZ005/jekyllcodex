## How we process your data

This website uses Google Analytics and Crisp Chat to track website visitors. If you don't like this, please use a script blocker, or do not use this website. However, we have taken all actions we can to limit the power of Google. We have configured Google Analytics to anonymize IP addresses, use SSL at all time and we have agreed a Data Processing Amendment with Google. These measures were taken from a derective of the CBP (Dutch Institute for Privacy Protection) from March 2013 on how to legally use Google Analytics while not showing a cookie warning. All forms on this website are handled by Formspree. Formspree has a mail server that mails all form contents to us. If you are uncomfortable with using this third party service, please do not fill out forms on this website, which (obviously) also includes the checkout form in the donation page/webshop.
