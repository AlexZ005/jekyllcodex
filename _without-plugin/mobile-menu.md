title: "Mobile menu"

### Introduction

If you want to add a menu to a navbar, you only have to add the menu as an unordered list with links. This script will take care of the rest. It will show the links in an inline-setting and show a hamburger with the word 'MENU' next to it. When you press the menu, the list items will appear below each other and the button will change into an 'X'.

### How it works

Create a navigation bar and add `id="mobile-menu"` to it. Inside this item, create an unordered list with links (or include [simple-menu.html](/without-plugin/simple-menu)). Add the script to the footer to take care of the rest. The script will toggle the mobile menu at the window width defined in the `width` variable. You can change the break point to suit your needs. The hamburger icon and the close icon are being generated by pseudo elements. No image is being used.

```
{% raw %}<div id="mobile-menu">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="/about/">About</a></li>
    <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>{% endraw %}
```

Or use [simple-menu.html](/without-plugin/simple-menu):

```
{% raw %}<div id="mobile-menu">
  {% include simple-menu %}
</div>{% endraw %}
```
