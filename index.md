## Pretty URL's

When you want your URL's to be pretty, simply use the 'old-school' approach. Create an 'index.html' in the root for the homepage and a folder called 'about' with another 'index.html' file inside for your 'about' page... and so on. You will take advantage of this on a later moment when you need to build a menu, based on the page hierarchy.
