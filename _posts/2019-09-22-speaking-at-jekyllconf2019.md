title: Speaking at JekyllConf2019
---

> #JekyllConf @jekyllrb Thank you for your @jhvanderschee, epic to see that you can build a Jekyll Site in under 20 minutes. If you missed it, catch up later on at http://jekyllconf.com

It has been an enormous honor to speak at JekyllConf2019. I was accompanied by some great speakers. The message of Chris Ferdinandy really resonated with me.

> #JekyllConf let's build a simpler, faster world wide web (be a dev dynosaur). Thanks @ChrisFerdinandi for a super inspiring talk!
