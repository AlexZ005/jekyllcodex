It has been an enormous honor to speak at JekyllConf2019. I got this nice reaction from the JekyllConf team. You can find my talk by clicking on the image above.

> [#JekyllConf](https://twitter.com/hashtag/JekyllConf?src=hashtag_click) @jekyllrb Thank you for your [@jhvanderschee](https://twitter.com/jhvanderschee), epic to see that you can build a Jekyll Site in under 20 minutes. If you missed it, catch up later on at [https://jekyllconf.com](https://jekyllconf.com)

I was accompanied by some great speakers. The message of Chris Ferdinandy really resonated with me. His statement was that the web is a mess and that we should fix it by using less frameworks. You can find his talk here:

> [#JekyllConf](https://twitter.com/hashtag/JekyllConf?src=hashtag_click) let's build a simpler, faster world wide web (be a dev dynosaur). Thanks [@ChrisFerdinandi](https://twitter.com/ChrisFerdinandi) for a super inspiring talk!

Before Chris, Pieter Roozen talked about using Jekyll as a data-source for React, perfectly illustrating the point Chris was trying to make. Nevertheless I think it was very brave of Pieter to talk about Jekyll at JekyllConf. If you are looking for some good references about using Jekyll to build JSON files, [look here](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll/output-json/). After Pieter, Hui Jing talked a little more about data files, a nice and very informative talk to listen to. After Chris his talk, Cat Roebuck spoke about using Jekyll on a really large project. She taught us some great best practises. I loved it. After her talk, Matthew Loberg thaught us some great best practises on how to use AWS as your hosting provider. So, if you want to use AWS instead of Netlify or Github Pages for hosting, this is the talk for you. Finally there was George Phillips. He talked about Enterprise Design Systems. I think he was talking about branding guides, but better.
