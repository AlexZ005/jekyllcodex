title: Speaking at JekyllConf2019

It has been an enormous honor to speak at JekyllConf2019. I got this nice reaction from the JekyllConf team:

> #JekyllConf @jekyllrb Thank you for your @jhvanderschee, epic to see that you can build a Jekyll Site in under 20 minutes. If you missed it, catch up later on at [https://jekyllconf.com](https://jekyllconf.com)

I was accompanied by some great speakers. The message of Chris Ferdinandy really resonated with me. His statement was that the web is a mess and that we should fix it by using less frameworks. You can find his talk here:

> #JekyllConf let's build a simpler, faster world wide web (be a dev dynosaur). Thanks @ChrisFerdinandi for a super inspiring talk!

Pieter Roozen talked about using Jekyll as a data-source for React, which Chris must not have liked at all and as you can understand from my enthusiasm for Chris his talk: neither did I. Nevertheless, if you are looking for some good references about using Jekyll to build JSON files, [look here](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll/output-json/). Hui Jing talked a little more about data files, a nice and very informative talk to listen to, if you decide to go that way. Cat Roebuck spoke about using Jekyll on a really large project. She taught us some great best practises. I loved it. After her Matthew Loberg thaught us some great best practises on how to use AWS as your hosting provider. So if you, like him, do not want to use the free Github Pages hosting and you want to use AWS, this is a great talk. Finally there is George Phillips. He talked about Enterprise Design Systems. I think he was talking about a branding guide, but better.
