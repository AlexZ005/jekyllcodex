I love internet memes. Ofcourse there is [grumpy cat] and the good old [rickroll]. But this one about [Mac Donalds rump](/uploads/macdonaldsrump.jpg) is going to be one of my favorites, as it is about website development.

This guy has [so many websites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkcqAkvZKlo), he has them all over the place! And he just hires people for three dollars.
