I love internet memes. Ofcourse there is [grumpy cat](/uploads/grumpycat2.jpg) and the good old [rickroll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&showinfo=0&rel=0). But this one about [Mac Donalds rump](/uploads/macdonaldsrump.jpg) is going to be one of my favorites, as it is about websites.

And if they are that cheap, you can have [so many websites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkcqAkvZKlo), you can literally have them all over the place!
