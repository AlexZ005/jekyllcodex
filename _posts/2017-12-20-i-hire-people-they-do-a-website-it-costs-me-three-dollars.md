I love internet memes. Especially internet memes about the internet. Ofcourse there is [grumpy cat](/uploads/grumpycat2.jpg){:.gray} and the good old [rickroll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&showinfo=0&rel=0){:.gray}, but there is nothing quite as satisfying as making fun of [Mac Donalds rump](/uploads/macdonaldsrump.jpg){:.gray}. And fortunately he does not stop at saying they cost only three dollars. Because the fun thing about websites being so cheap, as the big leader explains very well, is that you can have so many websites, you can literally have them [all over the place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkcqAkvZKlo)! That is right. All over the place (I think he refers to Amazon, GoDaddy, Bluehost, Google, etc.).

I think this is very amusing, and this is the thing I will be telling girls when I am totally wasted at the bar: "Wait listen... I have so many websites, I have them seriously... burp... all over the place... so many. And they cost me only three dollars. I just hire people." They will not get it... but I will feel superior nevertheless, because of all my websites... and my semi-clever joke.
