I love internet memes. Especially internet memes about the internet. Ofcourse there is [grumpy cat](/uploads/grumpycat2.jpg){:.gray} and the good old [rickroll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&showinfo=0&rel=0){:.gray}, but there is nothing quite as satisfying as making fun of [Mac Donalds rump](/uploads/macdonaldsrump.jpg){:.gray}.

And if websites are that cheap, you can have [so many websites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkcqAkvZKlo), you can literally have them all over the place!
