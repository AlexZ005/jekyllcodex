title: Interview with Joost van der Schee
---

This is a double interview with Michael Rose, who was interviewed by [{static is} The New Dynamic](https://www.thenewdynamic.org). I borrowed the questions The New Dynamic asked him and answered them myself. Please also read [his interview](https://www.thenewdynamic.org/article/interview-michael-rose/){:.gray}, as it is very inspiring.

### Hi Joost, how would you introduce yourself?

I consider myself to be a front-end developer. I graduated as Industrial Design Engineer, but started as a self-thought self-employed programmer as soon as I finished my masters 10 years ago.

### How did you come to adopt Jekyll as a publishing platform?

I already sold static websites since 2000, using Adobe Contribute as client CMS, and people asked me regularly to fix their hacked WordPress sites. That is why the Smashing Magazine article [Why Static Site Generators Are The Next Big Thing](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/modern-static-website-generators-next-big-thing/){:.gray} immediately got me interested. I looked up what the most popular SSG was (a lesson I learned from using WordPress) and got started. Before 2000, when I started using Adobe Contribute, I was using a static site generator called 'Merlin', built by my twin brother. It was built in 1996 in PHP and was database-driven. It used a custom type of Markdown in combination with FTP for deployment. The rise of flat files for content and version control in Git have improved things a lot for developers.

### What kind of websites are you working on?

I build websites for designers/advertising agencies. I think I build around 30 static websites each year.

### What do you like about the SSG workflow?

There are two things I like about working with SSGs.

- Their simplicity. Flat files easily viewed, edited, and generated into HTML. There’s no magic to process, you build the workflow you want.
- Their robustness. The fact they don’t rely on (communication to) a database means you have got so much less to worry about. Any hosting environment will do and security is not an issue.

### What is your most favorite feature in Jekyll?

Its use of Liquid. I’ve tried a few other SSGs and Jekyll has been by far the easiest the learn and build with.

### What feature do you miss the most?

Build speed is my main problem with Jekyll. That is why I am currently porting this website to Hugo at [hugocodex.org](http://hugocodex.org).

### Why is there so few Jekyll quality themes?

Yes, that is really strange. I think most Jekyll developers are people like Michael Rose. They are pretty good at CSS and they love to build their own themes and layouts. Jekyll also makes that really easy. Maybe it is too easy to build your own theme... I don't know.

### Why aren’t there more webdesigners working with Static Site Generators?

I think a lot of webdesigners think that SSG's cannot deliver high-end editing experiences for clients. They think manual image resizing is needed, form builders are not an option, graphical CMS systems have limited functionality. Also... clients often ask for a WordPres solution, as they have heard it is good (especially mythically good at SEO). Static Site Generators are not very well known yet.
